# Predictive-Modeling-of-COVID19-vs-GDP
done as part of CS771 course-work

With each passing day, the effect of COVID-19 is getting more and more severe. There are
continuous strains and ill-effects of COVID on healthcare status and social life of people. It has
recently been reported to infect a few animal species as well. Therefore, it becomes essential to
deploy technology to model its future trend and be geared up to control the pandemic.
Tracking the active corona cases as they bulge up helps governments and common people be
cautious about their future steps. They may then decide and form policies for better control over the
virus. It will lead to less havoc and lower fatality rate.
In this project, we aim to develop a probabilistic predictor for confirmed coronavirus cases in the
future 1 to 30 day window. Our objective is to predict the GDP of a particular region and correlate it
to the predicted COVID-19 cases and other indirect features on which GDP depends. Some of them
1
are percentage of unemployed people, age group of population, mobile cellular subscriptions, which
indicates expenditure of population.
